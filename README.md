## 🎯 Core Derivation

This supplement proves that on the boundary of the effective cooperation zone, the following two expressions are equivalent:

\[
\phi = \frac{A}{F\eta(2w + \tau)} - \frac{k_1}{2w + \tau} - \frac{2\sqrt{(dy + k_2)[k_0 - (e_L - e_R)\lambda]}}{2w + \tau} \tag{F.19}
\]

\[
\phi = \frac{\lambda(e_L - e_R) - \kappa_1}{2w + \tau} + \frac{2\sqrt{(dy + k_2)[k_0 - (e_L - e_R)\lambda]}}{2w + \tau} \tag{F.21}
\]

where:
- \(A = d(F(h_1 + 2Hy\eta) + h_2)\)
- \(\kappa_1 = k_1 + \frac{d}{F\eta}(Fh_1 + h_2)\)
- The equivalence condition is: \(2\kappa_1 - 2k_1 + 2dHy - \lambda(e_L - e_R) = 4\sqrt{(dy + k_2)[k_0 - (e_L - e_R)\lambda]}\)
